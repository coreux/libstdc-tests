# Standard C library test-suite

## Introduction

This repository contains a set of tests designed to determine the conformance to various standards of a Standard C library (often known as `libc`), and is intended to be integrated into an [automake](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/) project.

## Usage

### Integration

Incorporate this tree into your repository, for example in a directory named `tests`, and then add something similar to the following to your `configure.ac`:-

```
AM_CONDITIONAL([STDC_ENABLE_TESTS],[true])
AM_CONDITIONAL([STDC_ENABLE_FREESTANDING_TESTS],[true])

AC_SUBST([STDC_TEST_CPP],['${CPP}'])
AC_SUBST([STDC_TEST_CPPFLAGS],['-nostdinc'])
AC_SUBST([STDC_TEST_INCLUDES],['-I${top_builddir}/include -I${top_srcdir}/include'])
AC_SUBST([STDC_TEST_DEFS],['-DRUNNING_TESTS'])
AC_SUBST([STDC_TEST_LDFLAGS],[''])
AC_SUBST([STDC_TRST_LIBS],['${top_builddir}/libmystdlib.a'])

m4_include([tests/conftests.m4])

AC_CONFIG_FILES([
tests/Makefile
tests/freestanding/Makefile
])

AC_CONFIG_FILES([tests/run-cpp],[chmod +x tests/run-cpp])
```

Note that the values provided above are for example purposes: only `STDC_TEST_CPP` is required.

You should also add the following, if not already present:-

```
AC_PROG_CC
AC_PROG_CPP
AC_PROG_RANLIB
```

The conditionals `STDC_ENABLE_TESTS` and `STDC_ENABLE_FREESTANDING_TESTS` are used to determine at configuration-time whether to execute any of the tests.

The `STDC_TEST_CPP`, `STDC_TEST_CPPFLAGS`, `STDC_TEST_INCLUDES`, `STDC_TEST_DEFS`, `STDC_TEST_LDFLAGS`, `STDC_TEST_LIBS` flags are used when compiling the tests themselves, and so should contain whatever parameters are needed to compile against the C library being tested.

### Running the tests

The tests can be invoked via `make check` as normal (provided your `SUBDIRS` is set appropriately). The output produced will be similar to the following:-

```
PASS: c90-support
PASS: c90-stdarg-00
PASS: c90-limits-int
PASS: c90-limits-short
PASS: c90-limits-long
PASS: c90-limits-char
PASS: c95-support
PASS: c99-support
PASS: c11-support
============================================================================
Testsuite summary for mylibc 0.0.1
============================================================================
# TOTAL: 9
# PASS:  9
# SKIP:  0
# XFAIL: 0
# FAIL:  0
# XPASS: 0
# ERROR: 0
============================================================================
```

The `*.log` files generated by `make check` will contain the output from each of the tests. `freestanding/test-suite.log` also contains the summary of all of the tests within the `freestanding` directory, and so on.

## Caveats

The test suite assumes that the system provides a working `vfprintf()` and the program entry-point is `main()`. Modifications will be required if these are not the case.

The suite tests the _host_ system, but consisting of a set of runtime tests cannot be used in a cross-compilation environment unless the _build_ system is capable of running executables for the host.

In principle it should be possible to run the tests via tools such as [QEmu](https://www.qemu.org), but this has not yet been attempted.
